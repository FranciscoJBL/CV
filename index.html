				<h3>Experience</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h4>e-Digital Chile S.A <strong>Software developer</strong> </h4>
						<span class="dates">August 2017 - February 2018</span>
						<p>
							This was my very first job as a software developer, among my tasks was the development of an electronic signature application, 
							giving technical support to our clients (mainly mid size companies), make requirements analysis and database administration.
						</p>
						<h4>What I have learned</h4>
						<p>
							Without any doubt, the most important thing that i learned was to work on a team. More than technical skills, 
							the fact of having to work together with a team of 4 or 5 developers at the same time allowed me to understand the problems
							keys faced by an in-development application, and the importance of listening to others.<br>
							Technically, i worked with PHP, using mainly codeigniter as framework, plus some basic Javascript on the front end
							Here i learned about git, mysql, some scripting hacks, linux, docker and aws.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Andain <strong>Software developer</strong> </h4>
						<span class="dates">February 2018 - December 2018</span>
						<p>
							Currently i work in this same company, but not doing the same job. We are a electronic transaction company partner at Dominican Republic.
							My responsibilities consisted of backend development mainly, database administration and support.
						</p>
						<h4>What I have learned</h4>
						<p>
							If in my previous job the most important thing was soft skills, Andain was the contrary.<br>
							I worked with really smart and skilleds professionals, from which I have learned a lot.
							I understood design patterns, testing metodologies, how big companies work such as Visa, Claro, Banks, and integrated with them,
							The responsibility of working with a system that processes USD 2 million in payments per month, where availability is fundamental.
							One of our most important challenges, was migrate the system to a more reliable (and actual) technologies and create a horizontal scaling scheme, allowing us to separate the arquitecture from conventional MVC to a microservices one.
							The main technologies that we are using right now are: Hack (this is a typed version of PHP), postgresql, SOAP, Rest, 
							CI/CD and docker.
						</p>
					</li>
                                        <li>
						<h4>Andain <strong>Project Manager</strong> </h4>
						<span class="dates">December 2018 - Present</span>
						<p>
							Since December 2018 I inherited the leadership of the project, moving my tasks from development to requirements analysis, software architecture, proposal for improvements and administration of the work team. 
						</p>
						<h4>What I have learned</h4>
						<p>
							Comunicational skills and organization, the importance of understand the business.
                    		I learned to manage human resources, lead and allow them to properly develop his skills and, i think the most important part, listen to them!<br>
